# AeroPress Recipes

My attempt to produce a repeatable algorithm to create the perfect cup of Aeropress coffee.


### Version 2.

Pleasant and satisfying. More flavor than #1, but not as clear. Probably need to lower brew temp next time, possibly add more water to mug after the brew.

**Coffee:** Buddy Brew Cubano Espresso, 5 weeks after roast date. \
**Grind:** Medium fine, which is exactly a 4 on my K2.

 1. Heat kettle to 182F.
 2. Put 2 Stevia in empty mug.
 3. Invert Aeropress, set plunger at 4.
 4. Grind 16g medium-fine.
 5. Within 30 seconds of grind, add grounds, 160g water, start timer.
 6. @1:00 stir 3x with paddle. Add presoaked filter and cap. Squeeze out extra air. 
 7. @4:00 flip and press slowly for 30 seconds.
 8. Add additional 100g water to cup.

Very pleasant. Clear. Didn't want to put the cup down. Would have liked it a little stronger though. Measurements are somewhat ambiguous, so hard to reproduce with a different mug.
